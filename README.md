# rationals
_extended rational number type for javascript_

Why I think this lib is great:

- Representing fractions is not just easy, but it's natural. This is what
rational numbers do best. Operations like `0.1 + 0.2` are a pain in js,
but using rational numbers, it's just: `r(1,10).plus(1,5) === r(3,10)`

- This lib provides a type of object which will work with 1/0 or 0/0 just as well.
This is especially useful if you plan to plot values on a graph.

I've got the inspiration for this lib from here: [MF105: The extended rational numbers in practice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMQkLojL2ek)

# Examples
```
var r = require('rationals');

r(1,1) === r(1); // true

r(2,4) === r(13,26); // true

r(100,50) === r(2); // true

r(1,2).plus(r(1,3)).minus(r(1,4)).times(r(1,5)).per(r(1,6)) === r(49,70); // true

r(355,113).val(); // 3.1415929203539825


```

# API
_a & b are objects created with the rationals() function_

#### Addition
- plus

    `a.plus(b)`

#### Subtraction
- minus

    `a.minus(b)`

#### Multiplication
- times

    `a.times(b)`

#### Division
- per

    `a.per(b)`

#### Examining
- toString

    Examining an object can be hard, but if you cast it to a string: `r(355,113)+''` will return `'355/113'`.

    So will `r(625/125).toString()` return `'5/1'`.

#### Display
- display

    Just like toString(), but the numerator will be shown only if it's not 1. That is, integers will appear without a slash and a denominator.

    `r(625/125).display()` returns `'5'`.

#### Approximation
- val

    Will return the numerator divided with the denominator.

    `r(355,113).val(); //3.1415929203539825`

# Install
```
npm install rationals
```

**You can use it with [browserify](http://browserify.org/) in the browser**
To be honest, you can use it without browserify too, this it's just a module,
and it does not uses any kind of external libraries or other modules.
But browserify is awesome, so use it.
